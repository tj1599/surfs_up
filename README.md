## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to get W. Avy on board with investing in our business in Hawaii. His concerns were mainly regarding the temperature on the island. We were responsible for analyzing the temperatures for the months of the year.

## Results

Average temperatures in June are 3 degrees hotter than in December
Max temperature in December is 2 degrees colder than June
Minimun temperature in June is 8 degrees hotter than December

## Summary

I believe that there is no major differences in temperatures to affect the business throughout the year!
